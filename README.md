## About the Project

To validate first year of school, I had to develop an eshop. I choose to make a dropshipping site which sells Japan products. It aims Japan-friendly people but everyone can find what pleases him. Some features were asked on requirements specifications and some others were made to make the site more efficient. 

## Features

- Search bar (no page for search results because you can click results while you're doing research)
- You can review products! Only one review per account and product.
- There are promotions but they're not supported yet since there is no payment method.
- Some products are attached to a license. It's not used at this moment but can be useful to filter products!
- Filters aren't responsive. They only display when you're on desktop!
- Backoffice isn't responsive, admins shoudl'nt manage Choshi while on phone, or it won't be displayed as it is usually
- Choshi is made to be safe, even if you modify URL it shouldn't show error messages!
